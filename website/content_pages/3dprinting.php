            <p><b>What does it teach:</b> This 3D printing tutorial takes you by the hand from turning on your
                3D printer to your first successful print. It’ll still be good to come back to when you
                encounter your first common problems.</p>
            <p><b>Why use this tutorial?</b> Because it answers the most common problems you’ll encounter.
                Boldly titled “3D printing hacks”, it’s more like an “FDM 3D printer basics” tutorial.
                It guides you through the setup process that is pretty much the same for any consumer
                3D printer. The tutorial has the pre-print setup covered, but also shows you how to deal
                with emergencies like a clogged nozzle on your 3D printer.</p>
            <p><b>Level:</b> Beginner.</p>

        <div class="text_wrapper">

            <p><b>What’s the content?</b> It teaches you to scan with a Microsoft Kinect.</p>

            <p><b>Why use this tutorial?</b> There are many (fairly expensive) professional 3D scanners on the market. But many gamers already have a highly
                    capable solution to produce a detailed 3D scan right next to their TV in the living room. It’s disguised as a gaming accessory for
                    the Xbox 360 / Xbox One and called Kinect. It’s not only good for new forms of interactive input but with the right software, the
                    integrated camera also easily can be convinced to act as a high-quality 3D scanner.</p>

            <p>If you’d fancy being amazed by something that can be easily done with a PC, gaming console accessories, and by sitting still on a turning
                chair follows this tutorial on how to scan and 3D print with the Microsoft Kinect.</p>

            <p><b>Level:</b> Easy If you can use software guided by a tutorial, 3D printing a copy of yourself is only maybe an hour’s work and some patience
                for the scanning process away.</p>
